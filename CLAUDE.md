## Architecture Overview

### Core Concept
The project implements a "pressure relief valve" approach to context management:
- **Context Window**: 16k tokens maximum, 12k operational limit
- **Pressure Threshold**: Triggers at 80% capacity (9.6k tokens)
- **Relief Strategy**: Removes 40% of context (6.4k tokens) as semantic chunks
- **Background Processing**: Heavy operations (vectorization, graph building) happen asynchronously

### Key Components (Planned)

1. **Context Manager** (`src/virtual_context_mcp/context_manager.py`)
   - Orchestrates conversation flow and pressure monitoring
   - Manages context assembly from memory and current input

2. **Pressure Relief Valve** (`src/virtual_context_mcp/pressure_valve.py`) 
   - Handles context overflow through intelligent chunk extraction
   - Maintains optimal attention patterns by keeping context under 12k tokens

3. **Memory Storage Tiers**:
   - **SQLite**: Conversation archival and session management
   - **Qdrant**: Vector similarity search for semantic retrieval
   - **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph for entity relationships

4. **Story-Aware Processing**:
   - **Entity Extraction**: Characters, locations, plot elements, themes
   - **Chunking**: Preserves narrative boundaries and dialogue integrity
   - **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-modal scoring for memory retrieval

### Implementation Strategy

The project is designed for implementation in 15 discrete tasks:

**Phase 1**: Foundation (Tasks 1-6)
- Project setup, configuration, data models
- Token counting, chunking, SQLite storage
- Basic pressure relief mechanism

**Phase 2**: Memory Systems (Tasks 7-11) 
- Vector storage (Qdrant) integration
- Entity extraction and knowledge graphs (Neo4j)
- Memory retrieval and relevance scoring
- Core context manager orchestration

**Phase 3**: MCP Integration (Tasks 12-15)
- MCP server with story-specific tools
- Docker deployment configuration  
- Integration testing and CLI interface

### Key Design Principles

1. **Reactive Management**: Context operations only occur when pressure threshold reached
2. **Optimal Chunk Size**: 3.2k tokens preserve semantic coherence
3. **Async Decoupling**: Storage operations never block conversation flow
4. **Attention Optimization**: Working context capped at 12k tokens for optimal transformer attention
5. **Transparent Operation**: All context management invisible to user experience

## Story-Specific Features

### MCP Tools (Planned)
- `continue_story`: Add narrative content with automatic context management
- `search_story_memory`: Query past narrative elements  
- `get_character_info`: Retrieve character details and relationships
- `get_plot_threads`: Track active plot lines and connections

### Entity Tracking
- **Characters**: Names, traits, relationships, dialogue attribution
- **Locations**: Geographic and fictional place tracking
- **Plot Elements**: Story beats, conflicts, resolutions, dependencies
- **Themes**: Recurring motifs and narrative elements

## Development Environment

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose for database services
- 16GB+ RAM recommended for local LLM testing
- SSD storage for database performance

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd cont3xt
pip install -e .
# Note: Docker services and CLI not yet implemented - see Current Status below
```
